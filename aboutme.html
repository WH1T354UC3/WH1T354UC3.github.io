            My name is Madeleine Wolfe and I am from Northampton Massachuetts. I am currently studying Spanish and International Health with a minor in Computer Science and a passion for Cybersecurity. I am the Treasurer of <a href="https://cucyber.net" > CUCyber</a>, Clemson's Cybersecurity club, and TA a class about introduction to Cyber Defense. In my free time, I work on projects such as RFID research and designing this website. I also enjoy boxing, and sailing(espeicially considering the nice weather down here compared to up North). I plan to get my Master's in Computer Science and graduate in December of 2023. Please fill out the inquiry below if you have any questions, or are interested in collaborating.<br> Thank you, <br> Madeleine Wolfe
